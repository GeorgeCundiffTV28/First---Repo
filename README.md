she's got a smile that it seems to me that reminds me of childhood memories
at first i was afraid i was terrified thinkn i could never live with out you by my side but then i spent so many nights thinken how you did me wrong  and i grew strong and i lerned how to get along and now your back from outer space just walked in to see you here with that dumb look on your face
